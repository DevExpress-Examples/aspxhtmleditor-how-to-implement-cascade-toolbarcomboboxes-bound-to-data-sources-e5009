# ASPxHtmlEditor - How to implement cascade ToolbarComboBoxes bound to data sources


<p>This example demonstrates how to implement cascading ToolbarComboBoxes on the ASPxHtmlEditor toolbox. <br />

The selected value of the main combo box is transmitted as a parameter in a callback to the ASPxCallbackPanel. Then this value is used as a select parameter for the data source of the second combo box.</p>
